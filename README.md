# MobileNetV2-and-Xception-for-Skin-Disease
build model for clasificitaioin skin disease using cnn algoritm from model like MobileNetV2 and Xception. The model already trained with transfer learning and fine tuning in both of them

This is the result and Interface app 
![Result](ui.jpg)
Model will detect the skin disease using grad-cam to focused in object of skin disease. The red color indicates a focused model with a disease object that is used for a classification decision, while the blue color does not provide information or is weak in proving that the object is a certain class.
