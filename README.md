# Skin Disease Classification

This repository contains a deep learning project for **skin disease classification** using Python. The project leverages **Transfer Learning** and **Fine-Tuning** with **MobileNetV2** and **Xception** architectures, and it is deployed as an interactive web application using **Streamlit**.

## Overview

Skin disease diagnosis can be challenging and time-consuming. This project aims to provide a **machine learning-assisted solution** that can classify skin conditions from images accurately. The main objectives are:

- Implement and compare **MobileNetV2** and **Xception** models for image classification.
- Apply **Transfer Learning** to leverage pre-trained models.
- Use **Fine-Tuning** to improve model accuracy.
- Deploy the trained model to a user-friendly **Streamlit** web application.

## Features

- **Preprocessing:** Resizing, normalization, and data augmentation for improved model performance.
- **Model Training:** Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning for both MobileNetV2 and Xception.
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy, confusion matrix, and other metrics to assess model performance.
- **Web Application:** Users can upload skin images and get predictions via Streamlit.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- MobileNetV2 & Xception (pre-trained on ImageNet)  
- Streamlit for deployment  
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib for data processing and visualization
